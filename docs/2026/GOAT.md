# Querying genome metadata and sequencing projects using GoaT
This session will give you a hands-on opportunity to learn how the Genomes on a Tree (GoaT) database is used to extract genomic information, including estimates for a wide range of genome features (e.g. chromosome number and genome size), as well as sequencing status of genome sequencing projects globally.

By the end of this session you will:

- Have a  general understanding on what GoaT is and know what genome-relevant metadata (such as genome size, chromosome number, assembly span) are stored on GoaT.
- Have experience performing simple and complex queries using [GoaT Web](https://goat.genomehubs.org/) Interface to retrieve list of taxa and/or assemblies
- Understand the different indexes on GoaT (taxon and assembly) and how to query associated metadata
- Have experience viewing sequencing status and target lists for projects in the [Earth Biogenome Project](https://www.earthbiogenome.org/) Network.

## Material

In this session you will be following along a live demo of GoaT web, using the [set of slides provided](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S4deT4LbYH1KesFjVVfTQUPCKxLFDqyNf2w47PdxRjE/edit#slide=id.p) by the instructor.
